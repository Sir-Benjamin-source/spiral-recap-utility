summary: |
  High-level recap of a multi-turn design and theory conversation about Spiral Theory,
  the .srec artifact format, motif-driven compression/distillation, monitoring/checkpointing,
  the Spiral Information Efficiency (SIE) metric, and practical adoption steps (adapters,
  benchmarks, Zenodo-backed reproducibility). Priorities emphasized: rigorous theory-first
  proofs, a small reproducible experiment, schema + provenance, low-friction adapters, and
  privacy-aware pilot workflows. User preference: keep work open-source while offering
  specialized commercial pipelines later.

experiments_recommended:
  - id: "Experiment-A: Inference / Continuity Token Test"
    objective: "Measure token reduction with equal-or-better continuity when conditioning on .srec"
    brief_protocol: |
      For N sessions (N >= 100): compare three conditions (raw last-K-turns, naive summary, .srec).
      Use fixed model and metric. Log tokens (prompt+completion), compute SIE_token proxy (ΔLL or classifier MI proxy / |R|),
      run human Likert continuity ratings (3 raters per example). Paired stats: Wilcoxon + bootstrap CIs.
  - id: "Experiment-B: Retrieval Efficiency Test"
    objective: "Compare accuracy vs retrieved-token budget when indexing raw transcripts vs .srec"
  - id: "Experiment-C: Fine-tuning Sample-efficiency"
    objective: "Measure GPU-hours and tokens to reach target on a continuity/QA task using raw vs .srec-distilled training"

SIE_spec_brief:
  definition: "SIE(R;Y) = Î(R;Y) / C(R). Practical proxies: Î via classifier log-likelihood delta Ĥ(Y)-Ĥ(Y|R) or conditional perplexity; C(R) via token cost or GPU-hour cost."
  proxies:
    - "SIE_token = Î(R;Y) / |R|"
    - "SPT = downstream_metric_gain / |R|"
    - "TTT = tokens-to-target"
    - "GHT = GPU-hours-to-target"

monitoring_and_checkpointing:
  guidance: |
    - Bootstrap heavy human review for initial N sessions (e.g., first 50 or first 72 hours).
    - Compute motif stability metrics each recap: Spearman rank correlation, mean embedding cosine, motif churn rate.
    - Composite anomaly score example: score = 0.4*(1 - spearman) + 0.4*(1 - mean_cos) + 0.2*(new_rate); alert if > 0.25.
    - Log each .srec with content-hash, schema_version, and reviewer id if human-modified.

adoption_and_practical_steps:
  short_list:
    - "Add pinned requirements + pyproject / Dockerfile for reproducible demos."
    - "Publish one reproducible experiment + code + Zenodo snapshot."
    - "Ship adapters: LangChain memory, LlamaIndex document builder, vector DB indexer."
    - "Deploy a <2min demo (Colab or HF Space) and update README with direct link."
    - "Add PRIVACY.md and simple redaction guidelines."

poetic_seal: "Spiral-Path — motifs as pebbles in a river: place few, recall whole currents."
notes:
  - "User preference: theory-first; avoid premature lock-in of schema if an improved formal operator is found."
  - "Keep .srec modular: schema, motif-extractor interface, distiller, evaluation harness."
  - "Store this artifact in Git as conversation.srec and reference its path in any experiment provenance."
